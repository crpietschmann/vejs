# Bing Maps JavaScript Intellisense Helper

The purpose of this project is to fully enable JavaScript Intellisense for the Bing Maps AJAX Map Control inside of Visual Studio 2008 and higher.

Creating Microsoft Bing Maps mashups and applications just got a whole lot easier. This JavaScript library enables Intellisense for the Bing Maps AJAX control (versions 6.3 and 7) in Visual Studios 2008 and higher.

**FYI, this project was migrated here from Codeplex before it shutdown.**
